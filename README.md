# Exile Linux Server Files

These files are for those who wish to install the Exile Mod on a Linux server.
 Previous experience with Linux is strongly recommended, however is not required.


# Please read the readme.txt for install instructions.

### All credit for the Exile Mod and the server files themselves go to the ExileMod Dev team. The only modification that was made was the removal of the .dll files that don't work under Linux and the addition of extDB2.so. Thank you so much for your guy's hard work!
### ExtDB2 is licensed under GPLv3 and is authored by Torndeco. https://github.com/Torndeco/extDB2
